# Jekyll Theme

The Jekyll theme I created to power my blog, [bitsofco.de](http://bitsofco.de).


## Features

- Stripped back, content-focused layout
- Automatic generation of category pages
- Share articles via twitter
- Disqus comments
- Theme settings offer customisation for:
	- Colour scheme
	- Featured image and text
	- About blurb
	- Social media icons

## Credits

The autogeneration of category pages is handled by [a plugin created by shigeya](https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-category-archive-plugin).
